title: Ask the universe about Operations Research
---

I'm working on an operations research model and sometimes I just need a place to record my ideas.

But for a start, we're just going to leave some Shakespeare here (it's Prospero, in The Tempest):

> You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
> 
> As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
> 
>    Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
> 
>    As I foretold you, were all spirits and
> 
>    Are melted into air, into thin air:
> 
>    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
> 
>    The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
> 
>    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
> 
>    Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
> 
>    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
> 
>    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
> 
>    As dreams are made on, and our little life
> 
>    Is rounded with a sleep.
> 
> Sir, I am vex'd;Bear with my weakness; my brain is troubled:
> 
> Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
> 
> If you be pleased, retire into my cell
> 
> And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
> 
> To still my beating mind.
